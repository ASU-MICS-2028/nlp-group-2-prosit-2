# Backend

Owner: Elise (S-5 picked up by Perfect, see Handovers in PLAN.md and D-009) · Last updated: 2026-11-02 · Status: partly working (skeleton only)

## 1. In one sentence
A small Python server (FastAPI) that the web UI will call; today it only answers "are you awake?" and publishes its own API description.

## 2. What I did, step by step
1. Created `backend/main.py` with a FastAPI `app` and one endpoint, `GET /health`, that returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
2. Added CORS settings so the browser lets the frontend (on another address) call the server. Allowed addresses come from the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable, in `backend/config.py`.
3. Wrote tests for the normal case and for failure cases (unknown path, wrong method, allowed and disallowed origins, settings parsing).
4. Pinned the library versions in `backend/requirements.txt`; added `pytest.ini` so tests run from the repo root.
5. Wrote the API contract the frontend needs: `docs/api-contract.md` (D-008).

## 3. Why we did it this way
- **FastAPI**: small, readable, and it builds the OpenAPI description by itself, which the frontend client is generated from (D-001).
- **One config file**: environment settings are read in one place, so nobody hunts for them.
- **CORS limited to named addresses**: a random website cannot call our server from a user's browser.
- **Pinned versions**: the same code behaves the same on every laptop and in CI.

## 4. How to check it works
From the repo root:
```
python3 -m venv backend/.venv
source backend/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pytest -q                                   # 9 passed
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload           # then in another terminal:
curl -i http://localhost:8000/health        # 200 and {"status":"ok"}
```
Open http://localhost:8000/docs to see the interactive API page.

Two things people trip over:
- Run every command from the **repo root** (`nlp-group-2-prosit-2`), not from `backend/`.
- The virtual environment is switched on **per terminal window**. In a new terminal, run `source backend/.venv/bin/activate` again, or you get `command not found: uvicorn`. The prompt starts with `(.venv)` when it is on.

## 5. What is NOT done or is faked
- Only `/health` exists. The real endpoints (projects, answers, approve, events, download) are task W-5 and are described in `docs/api-contract.md`, which Elise has not reviewed yet.
- No sandbox runner (W-2), no agent loop (W-3), no storage.
- CORS and tests were checked locally; the first CI run has not been confirmed.

## 6. What will bite us
- `pytest` prints a warning that `httpx` is deprecated in Starlette's test client and suggests `httpx2`. It is only a warning today; if a future upgrade breaks the tests, switch the package.
- Run commands from the **repo root**, not from `backend/`, or imports like `backend.main` fail.
- Free-tier hosts sleep when idle, so the first call can take half a minute.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` must be set to the real Vercel address in production, or the browser will block every call.

## 7. Terms used
| Term | One-line meaning |
|---|---|
| FastAPI | A Python library for building web APIs |
| Endpoint | One address the server answers, like `/health` |
| OpenAPI | A machine-readable description of every endpoint; FastAPI makes it for us |
| CORS | The browser rule that decides which web pages may call a server |
| Virtual environment (venv) | A private folder of Python libraries for this project |
| pytest | The Python test runner |
| Pinned version | A library listed with an exact version so it never changes under us |

## 8. Lines ready for the report
- The backend is a FastAPI server whose published OpenAPI schema is the single contract with the frontend.
- Settings come from environment variables; secrets never live in the repository.
- Tests cover both normal and failure paths (unknown path, wrong method, disallowed browser origin).
